# Project: Function Front-End
The project consists of front-end (react.js) and smart contract (solidity).

## Description

The project's purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge of the student from Metacrafters, properly show how the program works, and most of all, to test the student's skill. In order to demonstrate the student's project, I was tasked to demonstrate on how to utilize react.js as front-end and co-exsit with solidity programming. 

## Getting Started

### Setting up the program

To run this program, Visual Studio is recommended because it requires to run locally in a terminal.
Before starting, make sure to initialize your folder with git init and clone by doing: git -clone <this_repository>

### Running the program
1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
